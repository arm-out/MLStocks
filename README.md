This is an ongoing project of mine that aims to create a predictive algorithm using machine learning to assist me as a trading strategy tool. While this may be able to make predictions to some degree of accuracy, I see this project as a basic starting point for me and anyone else interested, and can be used as the basis on which one could make a profitable trading system.

A more comprehensive rundown will be published as and when the initial project is complete.
